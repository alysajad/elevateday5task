TASK 5: CAPTURE AND ANALYZE NETWORK TRAFFIC USING WIRESHARK
================================================================

OBJECTIVE: Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types
TOOLS USED: Wireshark (Network Protocol Analyzer)
CAPTURE FILE: network_capture_task5.pcapng

NETWORK CAPTURE SUMMARY
=======================
Capture Duration: Approximately 1 minute
Total Packets Captured: 189 packets
Active Network Interface: Used for live packet capture
IP Addresses Observed:
- Local Machine: 10.0.2.15
- Remote Servers: 157.240.237.174, 52.55.0a.00 (and others)

PROTOCOLS IDENTIFIED
====================

1. DNS (Domain Name System)
   - Protocol Type: Application Layer
   - Packet Count: Multiple DNS queries and responses
   - Source/Destination: 10.0.2.15 ↔ 10.0.2.3
   - Purpose: Domain name resolution
   - Packet Details: Standard DNS queries (73-137 bytes)
   - Query Types: A records, AAAA records, PTR records

2. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
   - Protocol Type: Network Layer
   - Packet Count: Multiple ping requests and replies
   - Traffic Pattern: Echo requests/replies between hosts
   - Source/Destination: 10.0.2.15 ↔ 157.240.237.174
   - Packet Size: 98 bytes (typical for ping packets)
   - Purpose: Network connectivity testing and diagnostics

3. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
   - Protocol Type: Transport Layer
   - Connection Establishment: Observed TCP handshakes
   - Port Usage: Various ports including standard web ports
   - Data Transfer: Reliable connection-oriented communication
   - Status: Connection establishment and data transfer phases

4. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
   - Protocol Type: Data Link Layer
   - Purpose: MAC address resolution
   - Packet Size: 64 bytes
   - Function: Mapping IP addresses to physical MAC addresses
   - Network: Local network address resolution

DETAILED PACKET ANALYSIS
=========================

DNS Traffic Analysis:
- Query Types: Standard queries for domain resolution
- Response Codes: Successful resolutions observed
- Query Names: Various domain lookups
- Server: 10.0.2.3 (likely local DNS server/router)

ICMP Traffic Analysis:
- Echo Requests: Ping commands to remote hosts
- Echo Replies: Successful responses from remote servers
- RTT: Round-trip time measurements available
- Connectivity: Successful network reachability confirmed

Network Communication Patterns:
- Local to Remote: Communication with external servers
- DNS Resolution: Frequent domain name lookups
- Protocol Distribution: Mixed protocol usage typical of normal browsing

FILTERING TECHNIQUES APPLIED
============================
- Protocol-specific filters used (dns, icmp, tcp)
- Source/destination IP filtering
- Packet size analysis
- Time-based traffic analysis

SECURITY OBSERVATIONS
=====================
- Normal network behavior patterns observed
- No suspicious or malicious traffic detected
- Standard protocol implementations
- Proper DNS resolution sequences
- Legitimate ICMP usage for connectivity testing

TECHNICAL FINDINGS
==================
Network Interface: Active capture on primary interface
Packet Capture Format: .pcapng (Next Generation)
Analysis Depth: Layer 2-7 protocol analysis
Traffic Types: Web browsing, DNS resolution, network diagnostics

Key Protocols Summary:
1. DNS - Application layer name resolution
2. ICMP - Network layer connectivity testing  
3. TCP - Transport layer reliable communication
4. ARP - Data link layer address resolution

CONCLUSIONS
===========
The network capture successfully demonstrates:
- Multi-protocol network communication
- Proper protocol layering and interaction
- Normal network behavior patterns
- Effective use of Wireshark for traffic analysis

The capture file (network_capture_task5.pcapng) contains a representative sample of typical network traffic showing the interaction between different protocol layers and network services.
